    <p>
      Hi! I'm <span className="highlight">Shahzad</span>, a passionate <span className="highlight">Frontend & Backend Developer</span> with a love for building complete web applications — from elegant user interfaces to powerful backend systems.
      <br /><br />
      I hail from the beautiful city of <span className="highlight">Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh</span>, where I completed my schooling. After my 12th grade, I moved to <span className="highlight">Dehradun, Uttarakhand</span> to pursue my Bachelor's degree and dive deeper into the world of technology.
      <br /><br />
      Coding is not just a profession for me — it's my playground. When I’m not immersed in code, you’ll find me writing <span className="highlight">Shayari</span>, enjoying a good game of <span className="highlight">cricket</span>, or relaxing with some soul-soothing <span className="highlight">Ghazals</span>.
      <br /><br />
      I believe in the art of expression — whether it’s through beautifully structured code or heartfelt words.

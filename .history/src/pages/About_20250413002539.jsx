    <p>
      Hi! I'm <span className="highlight">Shahzad Ahmad</span>, a passionate <span className="highlight">Frontend & Backend Developer</span> with a love for building complete web applications — from elegant user interfaces to powerful backend systems.
      <br /><br />
      I hail from <span className="highlight">Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh</span>, famously known as <span className="highlight">The City of Tehzeeb</span>, a place celebrated for its rich cultural heritage and graceful manners. I completed my schooling here before moving to <span className="highlight">Dehradun, Uttarakhand</span> after my 12th grade to pursue my Bachelor's degree in technology.
      <br /><br />
      Coding is more than just a profession to me — it's my creative playground. When I’m not immersed in building robust applications, you’ll find me writing <span className="highlight">Shayari</span> (poetry), enjoying a thrilling game of <span className="highlight">cricket</span>, or unwinding with some soulful <span className="highlight">Ghazals</span>.
      <br /><br />
      I believe in the power of expression — whether it's through beautifully crafted code or heartfelt words that reflect the essence of life.
